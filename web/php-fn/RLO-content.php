      <h1>Recruitment Life-Cycle Solutions</h1>
      <p>Our strategy consultants work with you to create a full recruitment process, from justification of a new vacancy to on-boarding of new hires and any systems involved throughout the process. The process will cover the full recruitment life-cycle and will focus on providing the best possible experience to your hiring manager and candidates alike. Alternatively if you already have a recruitment process or system in place we will provide a recruitment function that will deliver your recruitment process and talent attraction strategy.</p>
      <br>
      <p> Recruitment Life-cycle Outsourcing services are a value-added version of the more typical RPO model. We focus on delivering excellent talent and superior services to your candidates and hiring managers alike. These services can be used to deliver your company's complete process, for a specific function, region or individual steps <span style="white-space: nowrap;"> within your process.</span></p>

      <h1>Recruitment Lifecycle Solutions are ideal for</h1>
      <p><h2>Start-ups</h2> often have aggressive growth plans in order to become profitable. The ability to grow your business relies on having the right people to deliver your services and to support your business. Creating a scaleable and sustainable recruitment process and strategy will set your business up for long-term success and can be delivered to ensure cost efficiency.</p>
      <p><h2>SME</h2> sized companies have had to make do with traditional recruitment agency services, as committing to the cost of a recruitment team cannot be justified by the number of new hires required. Outsourcing the full Recruitment Life-cycle to People Traction allows us to dedicate the resources required, meaning you benefit from the cost efficiency of having your own recruitment team without having to employ a full-time, in-house team.</p>
      <p><h2>Large organisations</h2> can experience significant costs and inefficiencies from a disjointed recruitment process. People Traction will help you define your recruitment process whilst allowing for regional or functional variances. Having defined this recruitment process, we will deliver our recruitment service, ensuring your hiring managers and candidates recieve an excellent experience.</p>
      <p style="display:inline;"><h2>Individual elements</h2> of your recruitment process can be outsourced using the Recruitment Life-cycle solutions. Our strategy consultants can be engaged to create the recruitment process to be delivered by your team or you could outsource the initial review of all your applicants to People Traction recruiters. Our strategy consultants will work with you to decide which steps could be outsourced to provide increased efficiency within your business.</p>
