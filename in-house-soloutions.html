        <h1>In-House Recruitment Soloutions</h1>
        <p>From the beginning a Strategy Consultant will work with your business leaders to define a full recruitment strategy. This strategy will define the methods your business uses to attract talent, how you brand is promoted on these channels and how your ever growing talent pool is managed to provide the maximum benefit in the future.</p>
        <p>Once your recruitment strategy is defined, if required, People Traction will provide a team of recruiters to work in your business who take ownership for the delivery of your strategy. These recruiters remain the employees of People Traction and the size of the recruitment team can flex to suit the needs of your business. Our recruitment teams can range in size from a single part-time recruiter to a full sized recruitment function suitable for a larger organisation.</p>
        <p>As employees of People Traction your recruiters will have continual access to the wider People Traction network ensuring they have the assistance of the strategy consultants, support of their fellow recruiters and ongoing training from People Traction providing them with all the skills they require to make your recruitment strategy a success.</p>

Our recruitment strategy and recruitment teams will allow you to attract and pipeline talent to make sure you can continually provide the best services possible to your clients.</p>

Engaging our services for specific projects will ensure you can deliver services to your clients without the burden of engaging 3rd party recruitment agencies or increasing the size of your recruitment team.</p>
