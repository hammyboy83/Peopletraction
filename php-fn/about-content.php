        <h2>Iain Hamilton</h2>
        <h3>Managing Director</h3>
        <p>  <img src="http://www.peopletraction.co.uk/images/IHphoto.jpg" style="width:25%;float:right;margin: 0 100px 0 100px;">I have had the privilege of gaining a diverse array of experience in both in-house and recruitment agency style positions. Most recently I managed the communication and marketing specialism for an FTSE100 organisation within the Strategic Resourcing function.

        </p>
        <p>Throughout my career I have been passionate about providing a seamless and enjoyable application process and have lead projects to design company websites, careers sites and job boards. The experience I have gained from this has given me great insight into the benefits of recruitment technology. Although recruitment technology has advanced significantly in the past 5 years, I still believe that technology cannot replace a good recruiter. To create a recruitment function that delivers, our recruiters must believe that candidate experience is our highest priority and be trained to deliver this experience.
        </p>
        <p>I have been instrumental in creating and delivering global proactive recruitment strategies and training recruitment teams in how to pro-actively resource passive and active talent. The results of delivering a pro-active recruitment strategy have shown significant reduction in time to fill, improved candidate quality and significant cost savings.
